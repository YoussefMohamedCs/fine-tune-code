[{"instruction": "What is a database?", "input": "", "output": "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system."} ,
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.", "input": "", "output": "SQL databases are relational and use structured tables with predefined schemas, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and designed for flexible, unstructured, or semi-structured data."},
{"instruction": "What is a primary key in a database?", "input": "", "output": "A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same key and prevents null values."},
{"instruction": "How can you improve SQL query performance?", "input": "", "output": "Query performance can be improved using indexes, optimizing joins, avoiding SELECT *, and analyzing query execution plans."},
{"instruction": "What is database normalization?", "input": "", "output": "Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity, typically through forms like 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF."},
{"instruction": "What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?", "input": "", "output": "INNER JOIN returns only the rows with matching values in both tables, while LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table."},
{"instruction": "Explain the ACID properties in databases.", "input": "", "output": "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability — four properties that ensure reliable transactions in a database system."},
{"instruction": "What is a foreign key?", "input": "", "output": "A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables."},
{"instruction": "What is indexing in databases?", "input": "", "output": "Indexing creates data structures that allow faster retrieval of records from a table, improving query performance."},
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of a database schema?", "input": "", "output": "A database schema defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints."}]
